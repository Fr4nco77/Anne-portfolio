Capturing the magic of an outdoor look requires more than just picking a location. Natural light is both your ally and your challenge: join me as we discover how to make the most of it in every session.


## Pre-Shoot Preparation: Planning the Session

Before heading to the set, define the mood and color palette.

- Choose outfits that contrast with or complement the environment.
- Check the weather forecast and plan around the golden hour (just before sunset).
- Pack portable reflectors to control shadows and enhance highlights.

## Golden Hour: Your Best Moment

That moment just after sunrise or before sunset offers soft, warm light.

- Set your camera to a low ISO (100–200) to preserve detail.
- Use a wide aperture (f/1.8–f/2.8) and play with background bokeh.
- Position the model with side lighting to sculpt the face.

## Poses and Angles: Natural Confidence

The key lies in subtle movement and shifts in perspective.

1. Walk slowly toward the camera to capture dynamism.
2. Tilt your body diagonally and slightly turn the chin.
3. Use soft hand placements: on the hip, brushing through hair, or interacting with the environment.

## Location Scouting: The Perfect Backdrop

Not every street or park works the same.

- Look for textures: stone walls, dense vegetation, or sandy paths.
- Verify access
