Paris Fashion Week is much more than runways and camera flashes: it’s a precise choreography of talent, pressure, and creativity. Join me as we relive every moment from backstage to the grand finale.


## Backstage Preparations

Before you hear the first chords of the runway show, the backstage is buzzing with activity. That morning, the scent of hairspray and freshly tanned leather blended with the murmur of stylists swapping brushes and pins. Every second counted: adjusting a hem, retouching a smoky eye, choosing the perfect pair of earrings.

Beyond the rush, there’s a sense of camaraderie. Models share tips for staying calm, makeup artists go over shadow palettes, and assistants dash around with suitcases full of outfit changes.


## Collaboration with the Styling Team

Working side by side with stylists is a subtle dance of trust and creativity. Each look is born from a brainstorming session: from the velvet texture to the geometry of the cuts. For my part, we chose:

- An asymmetrical emerald green satin dress
- Leather ankle boots with metallic embellishments
- Minimalist brushed silver accessories

Watching the sketches come to life is a real-time design masterclass: the right combination can transform a garment into a statement of intent.


## Adrenaline on the Runway

The heart beats in time with the spotlights. When I step onto that carpet, every move is an act of presence. The music pounds, the lights merge, and the audience becomes part of the choreography.

Those thirty seconds demand absolute focus. You feel the dress move, the structure of the heel, and the collective energy of designers, photographers, and the press.


## Final Reflections

As the curtains fall, you slip off your heels and a whirlwind of emotions emerges. Paris Fashion Week reminded me that fashion is ephemeral in its presentation but eternal in its impact.

Returning to the hotel, kicking off my shoes, and replaying each moment in my mind taught me that the real backstage has no curtains: it’s the stories we create and the lessons we cherish behind the scenes.
