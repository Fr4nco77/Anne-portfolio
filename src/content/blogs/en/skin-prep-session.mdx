Radiant skin doesn’t appear by magic: it’s the result of a consistent routine and carefully chosen products. Here’s my step-by-step protocol—from dawn to night—to look flawless in front of the camera.


## 1. Morning Ritual

The first step is to cleanse and awaken the skin.

1. **Gentle Cleanser**  
   I use a sulfate-free gel that removes impurities without stripping the skin’s natural barrier.
2. **Calming Toner**  
   I apply a green tea extract toner to balance pH and reduce redness.
3. **Sunscreen**  
   I never leave without a lightweight SPF 50 fluid—it shields against UV rays and creates a smooth canvas.


## 2. Targeted Masks

Before the shoot, I boost my skin with intensive treatments.

- **Hyaluronic Acid Mask**: twice a week for deep hydration.
- **White Clay Mask**: every ten days to purify pores and control excess oil.


## 3. Internal Nutrition and Hydration

Beauty also comes from within.

- I drink at least 2 liters of water daily with cucumber and lemon slices.
- I include vitamin C-rich fruits (kiwi, orange) and antioxidants (blueberries, berries) in my diet.
- I supplement with hydrolyzed collagen to strengthen skin structure.


## 4. Nighttime Care

Repair happens while I sleep.

1. **Double Cleansing**: first an oil cleanser to remove makeup, then a gentle gel.
2. **Regenerating Serum**: with retinol to stimulate cell renewal.
3. **Nourishing Cream**: with ceramides to reinforce the barrier and prevent moisture loss.
4. **Eye Cream**: a light jade roller massage to drain and minimize fine lines.


With this routine, my skin arrives at the shoot rested, glowing, and ready to catch every spotlight. Remember to adapt products to your skin type and stay consistent: the results show in every shot!
