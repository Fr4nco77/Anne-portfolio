# Dazed – Fragments Editorial in London

This session felt like stepping into a broken dream. I moved among projected lights, distorted reflections, and immersive sounds, letting each image tell a part of me that isn’t always visible. The garments were like puzzle pieces, each with its own voice. I loved being able to break symmetry, defy expectations, and let imperfection take center stage. It was a visceral experience, where emotion seeped through every frame. I felt free to experiment, to show myself without filters, to create from the deepest part of me.
