# Saint Laurent – Runway in Paris

Walking for Saint Laurent in Paris was one of those defining moments. The atmosphere was electric: dim lights, deep music, and brutalist architecture that amplified every movement. I felt part of a strong visual narrative, where fashion didn’t just dress—it spoke. The garments were sober, elegant, and full of character. Each step was an affirmation, a declaration of style and presence. It was an honor to be part of such a meticulously crafted production, where every detail was designed to convey power and sophistication.
