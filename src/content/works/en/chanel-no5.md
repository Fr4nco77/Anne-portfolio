# Chanel Nº5 – Perfume Campaign in Paris

This campaign felt like stepping into a film. From the very beginning, I felt I was telling a story with every glance, every movement. The perfume lingered in the air, wrapping me in an intimate and sophisticated atmosphere. I dressed in pieces that carried history, that spoke of strong, elegant, and free women. We worked in classic interiors, with soft light and tight framing that invited introspection. It was a delicate job, where silence spoke louder than words. I loved being able to merge fashion, cinema, and emotion into a single experience.
