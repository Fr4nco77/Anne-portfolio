# Nike – City Flow Campaign in New York

This campaign was pure adrenaline. I ran, jumped, moved through the city as if every corner were a runway. The garments followed every movement, and I felt I could express myself without limits. New York’s rhythm infused every shot, every gesture. I loved working with a team that understood the power of the body in action, aiming to capture not just the aesthetic but the energy. It was an intense, vibrant, and truly authentic project. I felt strong, free, and completely connected to my surroundings.
