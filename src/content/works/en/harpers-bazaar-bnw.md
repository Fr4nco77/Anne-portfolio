# Harper’s Bazaar – Black and White Editorial in Berlin

This session was a deep exploration of what can be said without speaking. I found myself in front of the camera in silence, letting each gaze, each posture, tell something intimate. Black and white forced me to strip away embellishments and trust in pure expression. We worked in an almost empty space, where light and shadow were the true protagonists. I felt vulnerable and strong at the same time, as if each image were an emotional mirror. It was an intense, artistic, and deeply personal experience.
