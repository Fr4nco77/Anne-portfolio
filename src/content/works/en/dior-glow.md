# Dior – Glow Collection

This campaign was a deeply sensory experience. I felt each layer of makeup melt into my skin, revealing a softer, more luminous version of myself. We worked in an all-white studio, where natural light took center stage. Each image aimed to capture the essence of beauty without artifice, allowing me to connect with a more subtle side of my expression. I loved working with such a meticulous team, where every aesthetic decision had a clear purpose. It was a delicate, elegant, and very personal project.
