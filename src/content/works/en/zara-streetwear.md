# Zara – Streetwear Campaign in Barcelona

This campaign was a celebration of the everyday. I walked through vibrant neighborhoods, among graffiti, cafés, and corners full of history, while the team captured real moments, without forced poses. I felt comfortable, free, and connected to the surroundings. The garments were versatile, designed to move, to live the city. Each look told a different story, and each image reflects that urban energy I love. It was a dynamic experience, where fashion blended with real life.
