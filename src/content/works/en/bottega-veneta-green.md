# Bottega Veneta – Green Drop Campaign

This campaign was a celebration of design in its purest form. I focused on accessories as protagonists, letting each bag, each shoe, speak for itself. The studio was bathed in green, a vibrant tone that contrasted with the sobriety of the garments. I moved with precision, seeking the right angle, the exact gesture. It was a technical job, but also highly expressive. I loved being able to highlight the detail, the small things, what often goes unnoticed. Each image was a thoughtful composition, a piece of art.
