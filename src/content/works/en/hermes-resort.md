# Hermès – Resort Campaign on the Amalfi Coast

This campaign felt like taking a deep breath. We were surrounded by cliffs, sea breeze, and a golden light that seemed to wrap everything. I moved calmly, letting the garments flow with the wind and each image capture that sense of pause and fullness. It was a project where luxury didn’t shout, but whispered through every texture, every gesture. I loved being able to connect with nature from a place of elegance and serenity. Each shot was a suspended moment, an invitation to inhabit the present with style and sensitivity.
