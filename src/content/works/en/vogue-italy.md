# Vogue Italia – Autumn Editorial in Milan

This session was a transformative experience. I walked through the streets of Milan wrapped in warm textures and elegant silhouettes, while the team captured each moment with artistic precision. I connected deeply with the concept of transition: between seasons, between emotions, between light and shadow. Each shot was an opportunity to express something beyond fashion—something that lives in the gesture, the gaze, the silence. I felt free, strong, and in tune with the surroundings. This project represents one of the most authentic facets of my career.
