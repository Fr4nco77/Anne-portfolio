# Terra Studio – Conscious Design Lookbook

This lookbook was a pause amid the fast pace. We were surrounded by nature, without artifice, letting the wind, light, and silence set the rhythm of each shot. I moved freely, in clothing that breathed with me, that embraced the body without imposing. I felt each image was a whisper, an invitation to look more slowly, to dress with intention. Working with a brand that places sustainability at its core was inspiring and deeply aligned with what I want to express as a model.
