# Comme des Garçons – Conceptual Project in Tokyo

This project was a full immersion in art. I moved among metal structures, cold lights, and deep shadows, letting the body speak louder than the clothing. The garments were sculptures, extensions of an idea, and each pose was an aesthetic decision. I felt part of a living installation, where time stood still and everything revolved around form, gesture, and emptiness. It was a project that demanded absolute presence, sensitivity, and surrender. I came out transformed, with a new perspective on what it means to model.
